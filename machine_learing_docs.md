**1. Scikit-learn (sklearn)**

Scikit-learn is a popular open-source machine learning library in Python. It provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms in Python. Scikit-learn is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn.

Key features:

- Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN.
- Accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts.
- Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
- Open source, commercially usable - BSD license.

**2. AutoSklearn**

AutoSklearn is an automated machine learning toolkit and a drop-in replacement for a scikit-learn estimator. It frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.

Key features:

- Automated selection of machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters.
- Can be used as a drop-in replacement for scikit-learn estimators.
- Based on the concept of Bayesian Optimization, Model-Based Optimization and Meta-Learning.

**3. GPlearn**

GPlearn is a Genetic Programming library in Python. It implements Genetic Programming with the efficient gradient boosting library LightGBM.

Key features:

- Symbolic regression is a type of regression analysis that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity.
- No need to specify the functional form of the regression equation: from simple linear models to complex non-linear models, any combination of mathematical expressions that best models the data can be considered.

**4. DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)**

DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. Its design allows for the use of any kind of evolutionary algorithm, be it a simple genetic algorithm or a complex evolutionary strategy.

Key features:

- Genetic algorithm using any imaginable representation
- Evolution strategy with the mu, lambda or mu + lambda type evolution.
- Genetic Programming with strongly or loosely typed trees in a tree-based or linear representation.
- Easy parallelization of algorithms.

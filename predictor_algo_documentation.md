2. Directional Changes Algorithm
A. Directional Change Event Identification
Objective
Identify Directional Change (DC) events and Overshoot (OS) periods in the price series for your ETH dataset. The goal is to capture significant price movements and their subsequent trends.

Detailed Explanation
The Directional Change (DC) algorithm is a method of summarizing price movements by focusing on significant changes rather than every tick. It identifies points where the price has changed by a predefined threshold
ùúÉ
Œ∏ from an extremum (either a local maximum or minimum).

Extremum Price: The highest (or lowest) price observed since the last DC event.
Event Types: 'upturn' indicates a potential upward trend, while 'downturn' indicates a potential downward trend.
Threshold (
ùúÉ
Œ∏): A critical parameter representing the minimum relative price change to consider a movement significant.
Implementation Details
Algorithm Steps:

Initialization:

Set the initial extremum price to the first price in your dataset.
Initialize the event type to None.
Iterate Over Price Series:

For each new price point, calculate the relative price change from the extremum price.
Price Change Calculation:
price_change
=
current_price
‚àí
extremum_price
extremum_price
price_change=
extremum_price
current_price‚àíextremum_price
‚Äã

Event Type Handling:

If the event type is 'upturn':
Downturn Detection: If price_change <= -Œ∏, a downturn DC event is identified.
Extremum Update: If current_price > extremum_price, update the extremum price and index.
If the event type is 'downturn':
Upturn Detection: If price_change >= Œ∏, an upturn DC event is identified.
Extremum Update: If current_price < extremum_price, update the extremum price and index.
If the event type is None:
Determine the initial event type based on the first significant price movement exceeding the threshold.
Event Recording:

Record each DC event with its type, index, and extremum price.
Update the extremum price and index upon detecting a new DC event.
Edge Cases and Considerations:

Threshold Sensitivity: The choice of
ùúÉ
Œ∏ significantly impacts the frequency of detected DC events. A smaller
ùúÉ
Œ∏ captures more events (sensitive to noise), while a larger
ùúÉ
Œ∏ captures fewer, more significant events.
Initial Event Determination: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies the initial event type to prevent misalignment in subsequent events.
Flat Markets: If the market is flat and price changes do not exceed
ùúÉ
Œ∏, the algorithm may not generate DC events. Handle this by setting a maximum time limit or a minimal movement threshold.

    return dc_events
Performance Optimization
Vectorization: For large datasets, consider vectorizing the computation using libraries like NumPy to improve performance.
Avoid Recalculation: Cache intermediate calculations, such as price changes, if they are used multiple times.
Memory Management: For very long time series, process data in chunks to manage memory usage.
B. Overshoot Period Identification
Objective
Identify Overshoot (OS) periods, which are the intervals between two consecutive DC events. The OS period represents the continuation of a trend beyond the significant change captured by the DC event.

Detailed Explanation
OS Periods: Following a DC event, the market often continues in the same direction before reversing. This continuation is the OS period.
Importance: Understanding OS behavior is crucial for predicting future price movements and enhancing trading strategies.
Implementation Details
Algorithm Steps:

Collect DC Events: Use the previously identified DC events.

Determine OS Periods:

The OS period starts at the index of a DC event and ends at the index of the next DC event.
For the last DC event, the OS period may extend to the end of the dataset or until a specified time limit.
Record OS Periods:

Store OS periods as tuples containing the start and end indices.
Edge Cases and Considerations:

Incomplete OS Periods: The last OS period may be incomplete if there is no subsequent DC event. Decide whether to include it in analysis.
Variable Lengths: OS periods can vary greatly in length. This variability is essential for modeling and prediction.
Code Implementation
python
Copiar c√≥digo
def identify_os_events(dc_events, price_series_length):
    os_events = []
    for i in range(len(dc_events) - 1):
        start_index = dc_events[i][1]
        end_index = dc_events[i + 1][1]
        os_events.append((start_index, end_index))
    # Handle the last OS period
    if dc_events:
        start_index = dc_events[-1][1]
        end_index = price_series_length - 1  # or a defined future point
        os_events.append((start_index, end_index))
    return os_events
Visualization
Plotting: Visualize DC events and OS periods on a price chart to verify correctness.
Annotations: Mark DC events with arrows or markers and shade OS periods for clarity.
Advanced Considerations
Multi-Scale Analysis: Consider analyzing OS periods across different thresholds to capture multi-scale market dynamics.
Statistical Properties: Analyze the distribution of OS lengths to understand market behavior.
3. Symbolic Regression for OS Event Length Prediction
A. Data Preparation for Symbolic Regression
Objective
Create datasets pairing DC lengths with corresponding OS lengths to uncover any underlying relationship between them using symbolic regression.

Detailed Explanation
DC Length: The duration or magnitude of a DC event.
OS Length: The duration or magnitude of the subsequent OS period.
Goal: Find a functional relationship
ùëì
f such that
OS_length
=
ùëì
(
DC_length
)
OS_length=f(DC_length).
Implementation Details
Calculating Lengths:

Time-Based Lengths: The number of time intervals (e.g., 10-minute bars) between the start and end indices.
Price-Based Lengths: The absolute or percentage price change over the period.
Data Alignment:

Ensure that each DC length corresponds to the OS length that immediately follows it.
Discard any incomplete pairs if necessary.
Normalization:

Scaling: Normalize the lengths to a common scale, such as z-scores or min-max scaling, to improve the performance of the symbolic regression.
Code Implementation
python
Copiar c√≥digo
import numpy as np

def prepare_data_for_regression(dc_events, os_events):
    dc_lengths = []
    os_lengths = []
    for i in range(len(os_events)):
        dc_start = dc_events[i][1]
        dc_end = dc_events[i + 1][1] if i + 1 < len(dc_events) else len(price_series) - 1
        os_start, os_end = os_events[i]

        dc_length = dc_end - dc_start
        os_length = os_end - os_start

        dc_lengths.append(dc_length)
        os_lengths.append(os_length)

    X = np.array(dc_lengths).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array(os_lengths)

    return X, y
Considerations:

Data Quality: Remove outliers or anomalies that could skew the regression.
Data Size: Ensure that the dataset is sufficiently large for the symbolic regression to find meaningful patterns.
B. Implementing Symbolic Regression Using DEAP
Objective

Primitives: Mathematical operations and functions allowed in the expressions.
Fitness Function:

Objective: Minimize the error between the predicted and actual OS lengths.
Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used.

def protected_div(left, right):
    try:
        return left / right if right != 0 else 1.0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return 1.0

def protected_log(x):
    return math.log(abs(x)) if x != 0 else 0.0
Updating Primitive Set:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
pset.addPrimitive(protected_div, 2)
pset.addPrimitive(protected_log, 1)

    func = gp.compile(expr=individual, pset=pset)
    predictions = []
    for x in X:
        try:
            prediction = func(x[0])
            if not np.isfinite(prediction):
                prediction = 0.0
        except (OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
            prediction = 0.0
        predictions.append(prediction)
    mse = ((np.array(predictions) - y) ** 2).mean()
    return (mse,)
Adding Pareto Front (Multi-objective Optimization):

Objective: Balance between minimizing error and complexity.
Implementation:
python
Copiar c√≥digo
creator.create("FitnessMin", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0, 0.1))  # MSE and expression size
def eval_symb_reg(individual, X, y):
    mse = ...  # As before
    size = len(individual)
    return (mse, size)
C. Running the Genetic Programming Algorithm
Algorithm Configuration
Population Size: The number of individuals in the population. A larger size increases diversity but requires more computational resources.
Number of Generations: How many times the population will evolve. More generations allow for more refinement but increase computation time.

python
Copiar c√≥digo
population_size = 500
num_generations = 50
crossover_prob = 0.7
mutation_prob = 0.2
Running the Algorithm:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
population = toolbox.population(n=population_size)
hof = tools.HallOfFame(10)  # Keep top 10 individuals
stats = tools.Statistics(lambda ind: ind.fitness.values[0])
stats.register("avg", np.mean)
stats.register("min", np.min)
stats.register("max", np.max)

algorithms.eaSimple(
    population,
    toolbox,
    cxpb=crossover_prob,
    mutpb=mutation_prob,
    ngen=num_generations,
    stats=stats,
    halloffame=hof,
    verbose=True
)
Analyzing Results
Best Individuals: Examine the top expressions in the Hall of Fame.
Complexity vs. Performance: Evaluate the trade-off between expression simplicity and predictive accuracy.
Validation: Test the expressions on a validation set to assess generalization.
Visualization
Plot Predictions vs. Actual: Compare the predicted OS lengths with actual values.
Expression Trees: Visualize the mathematical expressions as trees for better understanding.
Considerations
Overfitting: Be cautious of overly complex expressions that fit the training data but perform poorly on new data.
Computational Resources: GP can be computationally intensive. Optimize code and consider parallel processing if necessary.
Reproducibility: Set random seeds and document parameters for consistent results.
4. Multi-Threshold Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm
A. Threshold Setup
Objective
Select multiple thresholds to capture market dynamics at different scales and prepare for multi-threshold analysis.

Considerations
Threshold Range: Choose thresholds that cover a spectrum from small to large price movements.
Number of Thresholds: Balance the granularity of analysis with computational feasibility.
Currency Pair Characteristics: Adjust thresholds based on the volatility and behavior of ETH.
B. Generating Signals for Each Threshold
Objective
For each threshold, generate trading signals based on the predicted OS lengths and DC event types.

Detailed Explanation
Signal Generation Rules:

Buy Signal: Indicates an expected upward movement.
Sell Signal: Indicates an expected downward movement.
Hold Signal: No significant movement expected.
Prediction-Based Decisions:

Use the predicted OS length to determine the strength or duration of the expected trend.
Enhanced Signal Generation
Incorporating Threshold-Specific Rules:

For each threshold
ùúÉ
ùëñ
Œ∏
i
‚Äã
 , adjust the decision criteria based on the typical OS lengths at that scale.
Algorithm Steps:

Calculate Average OS Length for each threshold.

Determine Signal Strength:

Strong Buy/Sell: Predicted OS length significantly exceeds the average.
Weak Buy/Sell: Predicted OS length is slightly above average.
Hold: Predicted OS length is below or equal to the average.
Assign Confidence Levels:

Attach confidence scores to signals based on how much the predicted OS length deviates from the average.
Code Implementation:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
def generate_signals(dc_events, predicted_os_lengths, threshold_index):
    signals = []
    avg_os_length = np.mean(predicted_os_lengths)
    for i in range(len(predicted_os_lengths)):
        dc_event = dc_events[i]
        prediction = predicted_os_lengths[i]
        deviation = prediction - avg_os_length
        if deviation > significant_level:
            if dc_event[0] == 'upturn':
                signals.append('strong_buy')
            else:
                signals.append('strong_sell')
        elif deviation > 0:
            if dc_event[0] == 'upturn':
                signals.append('buy')
            else:
                signals.append('sell')
        else:
            signals.append('hold')
    return signals
Considerations:

Significant Level: Define what constitutes a significant deviation (e.g., one standard deviation above the mean).
Threshold Indexing: Keep track of signals corresponding to each threshold for later aggregation.
C. Voting Mechanism for Action Selection
Objective
Aggregate signals from multiple thresholds using a weighted majority voting system to make final trading decisions.

Enhanced Voting System
Incorporating Confidence Levels:

Signal Weights: Assign weights not only to thresholds but also to signal strengths (e.g., strong buy vs. buy).
Algorithm Steps:

Initialize Vote Counters for each possible action.
Iterate Over Signals at Each Time Step:
For each threshold, multiply the signal's confidence level by its weight.
Add the result to the corresponding action's vote counter.
Determine Final Action:
Select the action with the highest aggregated score.
Code Implementation:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
def weighted_voting(signals_list, weights):
    aggregated_signals = []
    action_map = {'strong_buy': 'buy', 'buy': 'buy', 'strong_sell': 'sell', 'sell': 'sell', 'hold': 'hold'}
    for i in range(len(signals_list[0])):
        votes = {'buy': 0, 'sell': 0, 'hold': 0}
        for signals, weight in zip(signals_list, weights):
            signal = signals[i]
            action = action_map.get(signal, 'hold')
            confidence = 2 if 'strong' in signal else 1
            votes[action] += weight * confidence
        # Select the action with the highest weighted vote
        selected_action = max(votes.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
        aggregated_signals.append(selected_action)
    return aggregated_signals
Considerations:

Normalization: Ensure that weights and confidence levels are normalized to prevent any single threshold from dominating.
Tie-Breaking: Decide how to handle ties (e.g., default to 'hold' or use previous action).
D. Optimization via Genetic Algorithm
Objective
Optimize the weights assigned to each threshold's signals to maximize the overall trading performance.

Detailed Explanation
Fitness Function: A key component that measures the quality of each individual (set of weights) based on trading performance metrics.
Constraints: Weights may be constrained to sum to a specific value or fall within certain bounds.
Evolutionary Operators: Selection, crossover, and mutation mechanisms tailored to the problem.
Fitness Function Design
Trading Simulation within Fitness Evaluation:

Nested Simulation: For each individual in the population, perform a trading simulation using the weighted signals.
Performance Metrics: Calculate metrics like Sharpe ratio, total return, and maximum drawdown.
Penalizing Risk:

Incorporate risk-adjusted performance measures to penalize strategies with higher volatility or drawdowns.
Code Implementation:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
def fitness_function(individual):
    weights = individual
    aggregated_signals = weighted_voting(signals_list, weights)
    portfolio_values = simulate_trading(aggregated_signals, price_series)
    returns = np.diff(portfolio_values) / portfolio_values[:-1]
    sharpe = calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns)
    max_drawdown = calculate_max_drawdown(portfolio_values)
    # Example: Maximize Sharpe ratio while minimizing drawdown
    fitness = sharpe - max_drawdown_penalty * max_drawdown
    return (fitness,)
Considerations:

Max Drawdown Penalty: Choose an appropriate penalty factor to balance return and risk.
Computational Efficiency: Optimize the simulation code since it runs multiple times during the GA.
Genetic Algorithm Configuration
Initialization:

Diverse Initial Population: Generate individuals with a wide range of weight combinations.
Selection Method:

Roulette Wheel Selection: Probabilistic selection favoring individuals with higher fitness.
Tournament Selection: Select the best individual among a random subset.
Crossover and Mutation:

Crossover: Use methods suitable for real-valued vectors, such as cxBlend or cxSimulatedBinary.
Mutation: Apply Gaussian mutation with adaptive parameters.
Constraints Handling:

Normalization Constraint: After crossover or mutation, normalize weights to sum to 1.
Boundary Constraint: Ensure weights remain within specified bounds (e.g., [0, 1]).
Code Implementation Enhancements:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
def normalize_weights(individual):
    total = sum(individual)
    if total > 0:
        individual[:] = [w / total for w in individual]
    else:
        # Assign equal weights if total is zero
        individual[:] = [1.0 / len(individual)] * len(individual)

# Decorate the operators
toolbox.decorate("mate", tools.DeltaPenalty(feasible, penalty))
toolbox.decorate("mutate", tools.DeltaPenalty(feasible, penalty))
Considerations:

Feasibility Function: Define a function feasible that checks if the individual meets constraints.
Penalty Function: Define a penalty function penalty that reduces the fitness of infeasible individuals.

Position Sizing: Decide how much capital to allocate to each trade.
Enhanced Simulation
Components to Include:

        if position != 0:
            risk_action = apply_risk_management(position, price, entry_price, stop_loss_pct, take_profit_pct)
            if risk_action == 'close':
                # Close position
                cash += position * holdings * price * (1 - transaction_cost)
                holdings = 0

                cash += holdings * price * (1 - transaction_cost)
                holdings = 0
            # Open long position
            units = cash / price * (1 - transaction_cost)
            holdings = units
            cash -= units * price
            position = 1
            entry_price = price
        elif action == 'sell' and position >= 0:
            if position == 1:
                # Close long position
                cash += holdings * price * (1 - transaction_cost)
                holdings = 0
            # Open short position
            units = cash / price * (1 - transaction_cost)
            holdings = -units

        # Update portfolio value
        portfolio_value = cash + holdings * price
        portfolio_values.append(portfolio_value)
    return portfolio_values
Considerations:

Margin Requirements: If trading on margin, ensure that margin calls are appropriately handled.
Position Limits: Set limits on the maximum position size to control exposure.
B. Risk Management
Objective
Enhance the trading strategy by incorporating advanced risk management techniques to protect the portfolio from significant losses.

Advanced Risk Management Techniques
Volatility-Based Position Sizing:

Adjust position sizes based on the volatility of the asset.
Use metrics like Average True Range (ATR) to determine appropriate stop-loss levels.
Trailing Stops:

Implement trailing stop-loss orders that adjust with favorable price movements.
Diversification:

If applicable, diversify across multiple assets or trading strategies to reduce unsystematic risk.
Code Implementation Enhancements:

Copiar c√≥digo
def apply_risk_management(position, price, entry_price, stop_loss_pct, take_profit_pct):
    if position == 1:
        profit_loss_pct = (price - entry_price) / entry_price
    elif position == -1:
        profit_loss_pct = (entry_price - price) / entry_price
    else:
        return 'hold'
    if profit_loss_pct <= -stop_loss_pct:
        return 'close'
    elif profit_loss_pct >= take_profit_pct:
        return 'close'
    else:
        return 'hold'
Considerations:

Visualization:

Equity Curve: Plot the portfolio value over time.
Drawdown Chart: Visualize drawdowns to understand the duration and depth of losses.
Distribution of Returns: Plot histograms or kernel density estimates.
Considerations:

Benchmark Comparison: Compare the strategy's performance against a relevant benchmark.
Statistical Significance: Use statistical tests to determine if the performance is not due to random chance.
7. Evaluation
A. Comparison with Benchmarks
Objective
Assess how the MTDC strategy performs relative to other strategies to determine its effectiveness.

Detailed Comparison
Consistency Across Periods: Evaluate performance in different market conditions (e.g., bull vs. bear markets).
Risk-Adjusted Returns: Compare metrics like Sharpe and Sortino ratios to account for risk.
B. Statistical Significance Testing
Objective
Use statistical methods to verify whether the observed performance differences are significant.

Advanced Statistical Tests
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): If the assumptions are met, use ANOVA to compare means across multiple strategies.
Post-Hoc Tests: Apply tests like Tukey's HSD to identify specific group differences.
Code Implementation for Nemenyi Test:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
import scikit_posthocs as sp

# Combine returns into a DataFrame
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'MTDC': returns_mtdc,
    'Single Threshold': returns_single,
    'RSI': returns_rsi,
    'Buy and Hold': returns_bh
})

# Perform Nemenyi test
nemenyi_results = sp.posthoc_nemenyi_friedman(data.T)
print(nemenyi_results)
Interpretation:

Significance Levels: Determine which strategies differ significantly from each other.
Practical Significance: Consider the economic impact of the differences, not just statistical significance.
Additional Considerations
A. Validation and Robustness
Objective
Ensure the strategy's performance is robust and generalizes well to new data.

Techniques
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess performance stability.
Sensitivity Analysis: Test how changes in parameters (e.g., thresholds, stop-loss levels) affect performance.
B. Risk Management Enhancements
Objective
Further improve the strategy's resilience to adverse market conditions.

Techniques
Stress Testing: Simulate extreme market scenarios to evaluate the strategy's behavior.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Randomly generate multiple performance paths to estimate the range of possible outcomes.
C. Implementation for Live Trading
Objective
Prepare the strategy for deployment in a live trading environment.

Considerations
Algorithm Latency: Optimize code for low-latency execution if trading frequency is high.
Monitoring and Alerts: Implement real-time monitoring to detect anomalies or errors promptly.
Compliance and Reporting: Ensure that all trading activities are logged and comply with relevant regulations.
